    <p>In mid-September of this year, epidemiologists were surprised to find a new coronavirus variant (or strain) that was markedly different from all the others. This strain was observed in Kent and the Greater London area of the U.K. This strain, named B.1.1.7, continued to appear throughout the U.K. and a few other countries.All viruses can mutate. The molecules that code the genetic sequence (DNA or RNA), like any physical thing, can change over time. This new variant is worrisome for being harmful because a mutation in its behavior may cause it to be spread more easily. Pandemic fatigue is real, especially during the winter holidays at the end of a difficult year. Distancing and supporting each other other as we ramp up the vaccinations, this is how we can get through this together.</p>

    <p>This year we have collectively experienced massive trauma on a scale some scholars have likened to the societal impact of World War II and the Great Depression—events that have lived exclusively in the pages of history textbooks for my generation. Everything happens for a reason seemed to be the comfort phrase of choice in the spring as my peers were furloughed from jobs or forced to move back home with their parents. </p>

    <h3>Why a Hot Ginger Bath Is the Perfect Detox Ritual for Winter</h3>
    <p>For centuries, ritual bathing has been practiced in China for its soothing mind-body benefits. And come winter, any dip in the tub would be remiss not to include a zing of ginger, says Anna Lam, founder of natural skin-care brand GingerChi. Ginger has been used in Asian cultures for thousands of years for culinary and medicinal purposes due to its anti-inflammatory, circulation-boosting, and digestion-aiding effects year-round. But, the fibrous root becomes that much more crucial during the colder months, thanks not just to its naturally warming properties, but its accordance with the traditional Chinese concept of chi, which is the energy force inherent in all living things. In order for chi to circulate, there must be balance—otherwise known as the ancient philosophy of yin and yang.“The heat of a warm bath and the ‘yang’ energy of ginger is much needed for the ‘yin’ season of winter,” explains Lam. “Eating ginger, drinking ginger tea, and taking a ginger bath all help warm the meridians, opening the blockages to promote the flow of blood and the chi throughout the body. Bathing during the cooler months is essential as it helps bring the body back into balance, improves circulation, and fortifies the immune system.”</p>

    <h3>Under-Eye Patches to Banish Puffiness Once and for All</h3>
    <p>Under-eye patches may be all the rage on Instagram thanks to everyone from Victoria Beckham to Kaia Gerber and Cindy Crawford, but as it turns out the double-tap-worthy treatment packs a serious punch. Though not intended for everyday use, they offer a “boost” to the delicate area on especially swollen mornings, notes Hollywood facialist Mila Moursi. (The root causes of that puffiness? Pollution, poor sleep, inadequate makeup removal, and hot, dry indoor air—as well as heavy creams, which can overburden the skin at night, she adds.) The latest wave of masks contain a host of de-puffing, fine-line-plumping actives, from caffeine and rejuvenating rose quartz to 24-karat gold. Here, the best under-eye patches to stock up on now. A favorite in the Vogue office, BeautyBio’s collagen-infused gel masks—made with illuminating pearl and colloidal silver—fake the appearance of a full-night’s rest, even if life is running at a breakneck pace. Consider Chanel’s luxe firming two-step system—a roll-on serum and hydrogel patches stamped with the French house’s logo—the 2.55 of eye care.Experience celebrity facialist Joanna Vargas’s sought-after touch from the comfort of your own couch with these brightening eye patches, which are the go-to among many a Hollywood starlet.</p>

    <h3>Model Salem Mitchell Shares Her Hair Journey, and How She Cares for Her Braids</h3>
    <p>
     <i id="cnt">Texture Diaries is a space for Black people across industries to reflect on their journeys to self-love, and how accepting their hair, in all its glory, played a pivotal role in this process. </i>
     <br>When it comes to caring for her knotless braids, Mitchell gets them redone once a month, which is when she also ensures to deep-condition her hair. She swears by a paddle brush for detangling, and nourishes her strands with oils. (“I had a braider once tell me that oil for hair is like water for plants. That really stuck with me.”) She uses one in particular from Natural Beauty, a concoction of oils including castor coconut, grape seed, and tea tree. “It’s nice to have them all in one,” she notes. Her favorite edge control is from Murray’s.

    <div class="grid-item item4"></div>
  </div>
  <p>When she considers what’s next in her hair journey, Mitchell says she wants to dive into the world of wigs. “A lot of the time when Black women wear wigs, we’re given a hard time, but when others do it, it’s seen as cool and quirky,” she says. “I think wigs are amazing and glamorous, I just want to master laying them down better.”<br>“Experimenting in a healthy way is a beautiful thing,” she says of her biggest hair lesson to date. Take risks and learn about new styles, without fear of being judged by peers.”</p>
